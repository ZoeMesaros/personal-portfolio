            My name is ZoÃ«, I'm a developer student at Medieinstitutet in
            Stockholm specializing in E-commerce. Before starting this school I
            had no previous experience with programming but computers have
            always been part of my life and are a big passion of mine. My school
            is providing basic knowledge in both back and frontend development
            such as HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Typescript, API, Database, PHP
            and React. I am eager to learn and challenge myself to grow my
            knowledge. I am looking for LIA internship for autumn 2023 Between
            2023-10-16 and 2023-12-24.
