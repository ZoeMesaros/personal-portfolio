            My name is ZoÃ«, I'm a developer student at Medieinstitutet in
            Stockholm specializing in E-commerce. Computers have always been
            part of my life and is a big passion. I joined this school because i
            have always been fascinated with the web and how it works. My school
            is providing basic knowledge in both back and frontend development
            such as HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Typescript, API, Database, PHP
